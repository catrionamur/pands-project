This script will take in Iris dataset which describes the characteristics of the Iris flowers
The data sets consists of 3 different types of species of Iris they are Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica.  The sample size is 151 and includes the features of the flower, which are petal and sepal length and width and of course the class of the flower.  The data set consists of over 50 samples from each of three species of Iri
The Iris dataset was introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fishers his 1936 paper and it is widly used ever since 
The dataset was downloaded from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-basics-of-pandas-using-iris-dataset/
Histograms are used to show distributions of data in this case we have 4 histograms 
When using the histogram where densities are included in the same plot, this tells us that the setosa flowers have a petal length between 1 and 1.8. And Versicolor has petal lengths between 3 and 5.2 and Virginica hs petal length between 4.5 and 6.9.
Scatterplot is used when the visualization data contains only one-dimensional data points, they are suitable to find the relationship between two variables such as sepal length and sepal width.  
Petal Length for Setosa is fully separated from the other two classes but Versicolor and Virginica are not fully separated they have some overlap of some data points
Boxplot display the summary of the set of data values having properties like minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile and maximum
The Scatter plot is the 2D plot the representation of the relationship between two variables.  It has a five-number summary of a set of data. The five-number summary is the minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum.
Pairs plot is a matrix of scatterplots that lets you understand the pairwise relationship between different variables in a dataset.
